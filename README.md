## PROBLEM SOLVING
> To solve this case study, I need to systematically analyze the information provided and use a structured approach to address the questions based on real-world scenarios as a QA Engineer/Analyst would.

> Access the web application: Open a web browser and navigate to https://cmms.dev.aegislabs.work/#/page/assets/meters-&-groups Check that the web application is accessible and loads without any errors.

> Document issues: Create a professional QA report that documents all the issues identified during testing. Include details such as the steps to reproduce the issue, the expected behavior, and the actual behavior. Categorize the issues based on severity and priority to help the development team prioritize and address them.

> Design automated functional testing code and scripts: Using Cypress, design and implement automated functional testing scripts that test the CMMS feature of the web application. Make assumptions for the application's standard requirements and ensure that the expected results for feature and website behaviors are met.

> Provide clear instructions: Write clear instructions/guide documents on how to set up and execute the automated testing scripts. Include sample results for reference.

> Document test cases: Create a comprehensive test cases document that includes both manual and automated test cases conducted. List all the test cases and their expected results.


### Table of Contents

### 1. Overview:
Provide a concise introduction: 
1. Objective: To evaluate the functionality of the CMMS module "Meters & Groups" through manual and automated tests.
2. Scope: Cover both positive and negative test cases for all critical functionalities of the module. 
3. Tools Used: Cypress, PDF, Microsoft Excel.

### 2. Test Plan:
Purpose 
The purpose of this document is to ensure the quality and functionality of the "Meters & Groups" module in CMMS. This includes validating core features such as CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and ensuring the module's robustness against invalid inputs.

1. In-Scope 
• Functional testing of all visible features.
• Positive and negative test cases for CRUD operations.
• Validations for UI elements, error handling, and form inputs.

### 2. Out-of-Scope 
• Performance testing.
• Automation: Cypress with Cucumber integration.

### 3. Testing Tools 
• Manual Testing: PDF and Microsoft Excel for documentation.
• Automation: Cypress with Cucumber integration.
• CI/CD: GitHub and Git Action 

### 3. Test Strategy:
Test Types 
1. Manual Testing 
• Perform exploratory testing to identify core scenarios.
• Validate functionality step-by-step based on user workflows.

2. Automation Testing 
• Use Cypress for automated regression and smoke tests.

3. Execution Environment
• Browser: Google Chrome (Latest).
• Resolution: 1920x1080.
• OS: Windows 11

### 4. Test Case Coverage:
Features to Test is the Performance output of exploratory testing to identify core scenarios of the "Meters & Groups" module in CMMS. 
Complexity Levels 
• Low: Input field validation (e.g., mandatory fields).
• Medium: CRUD operations and form workflows.
• High: Combined functionalities (e.g., search + filter).

### 5. Manual Test Cases:
PDF & Microsoft Excell for Test Cases Documentation

### 6. Cypress Automation Test Cases:
• Automation: Cypress integration.
• CI/CD: GitHub and Git Action 

### 7. Complexity Analysis:
Complexity Levels 
• Low Complexity: Field-level validations, login/logout scenarios
• Medium Complexity: CRUD functionalities and search features.
• High Complexity: Combinations of search, filter, and CRUD actions.

### Conclusion:
This document ensures robust test coverage for the "Meters & Groups" module, aligning with QA best practices. All positive and negative cases are tested to identify bugs early and ensure high-quality deliverables.
